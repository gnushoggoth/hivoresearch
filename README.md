# 🧬 HivoResearch

Welcome to **HivoResearch**, a dynamic playground where **bioinformatics meets curiosity**! This project dives deep into **HIV research**, computational modeling, and a touch of tech magic. Whether you're here for **data science, GPU-accelerated computing, or cutting-edge biomedical insights**, you've found the right place. 🧪✨

## 📂 What's in the Box?

This repository is a **treasure trove** of computational tools, tutorials, and research goodies. Here's a quick peek at what you'll find:

- **🎨 `DraculaFlowArtPage.tsx`** – A TypeScript React component that might just make data **look cool** (or at least a little spookier). 🦇
- **📘 `README.md`** – The guidebook to our scientific expedition.
- **⚙️ `cuda-test-guide.md`** – A step-by-step **walkthrough of CUDA tests** (for those who like their computations **blazing fast**). 🔥
- **📚 `cuda-tutorial.tsx`** – A React-based introduction to **CUDA-powered programming**, because GPUs aren’t just for gaming! 🎮
- **🎮 `gdpr-game-setup.md`** – A playful take on **regulatory simulations**, proving compliance can actually be... fun? (Okay, maybe "fun" is a stretch.)
- **📊 `ghostly_analytics_proof_of_concept.ipynb`** – A **data-driven ghost hunt** through biomedical analytics. 👻💡

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Prerequisites
To unlock the full potential of this repo, you'll need:
