## Sample Narrative

> The air in the abandoned warehouse hung thick, heavy with mildew and something else—something metallic, like old blood. Sweat trickled down my neck, and not just from the heat. The shadows danced in the corners, playing tricks on my eyes. Was that a flicker of movement, a pair of red eyes reflecting in the darkness?
>
> They called him the Harbinger. Whispers on the street, in the dark corners of the internet. They said he offered a way out, a way to transcend the decay, the rot that clung to this city like a second skin. But the price… the price was a question no one dared to ask aloud.
>
> The Vessel, a young man named Marcus, his eyes sunken and feverish, muttered about wings and a new kind of light. His skin, once a rich brown, now had a disturbing pallor, almost translucent. I watched him, wary, like a rabbit watching a snake. The racial tension in this city was a live wire, and this… this felt like a storm was brewing. A Venti-sized storm.
