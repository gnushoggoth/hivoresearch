    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "We are evaluating a short‐term (48‐hour) liquidation strategy for 50% of a particular crypto token. By examining recent price history, short‐term volatility, and a hypothesized bounce, we aim to set a realistic limit‐sell price target in the range of \\$0.88–\\$0.90. This approach balances (a) the likelihood of order execution and (b) an acceptable profit margin, given the token’s current trading price of \\$0.85.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Business Problem / Use Case\n",
    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "- We need a data‐driven, short‐term selling strategy for a crypto token that is currently down from a local high of \\$1.60.\n",
    "- The immediate goal: Sell 50% of current holdings within 48 hours at the “best” possible price, without excessively risking that the order won’t fill.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters**\n",
    "- **Cash Flow & Profit Goals**: Capturing a partial rebound can help secure liquid capital for other business or investment initiatives.\n",
    "- **Risk Management**: Fully waiting for a higher price might lead to missed opportunities or rapid drawdowns if the market slips further.\n"

    "## 3. Data & Assumptions\n",
    "1. **Current Price**: \\$0.85 (approx.).\n",
    "2. **Recent High**: \\$1.60 (local high in the past few months).\n",
    "3. **Price Drop**: ~46–47% from that local high.\n",
    "4. **Historical Volatility**: Over the past few weeks, the token’s price has swung between \\$0.80 and \\$1.30.\n",
    "5. **Hypothesized 20% Bounce**: From \\$0.85 to roughly \\$1.00, based on short‐term market sentiment and chart patterns.\n"

    "## 4. Methodology & Analytical Framework\n",
    "### 4.1 Model Setup\n",
    "- **Time Horizon**: 48 hours for execution.\n",
    "- **Price Function** (\\(P(t)\\)): Representing the token’s market price over time.\n",
    "- **Short‐Term Growth Estimate**:\n",
    "  - We assume a moderate upward drift (i.e., price appreciation of 15–20%) if market sentiment improves.\n",
    "  - We factor in typical crypto volatility (short‐term spikes/dips) to account for the possibility that the final price may be lower than an “ideal” bounce target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Data‐Driven Calculations\n",
    "- **Taylor‐Like Expansion (Simple Forecasting)**:\n",
    "  \\(\n",
    "    P(t) \\approx P(0) + P'(0) \\times t + \\tfrac{1}{2} P''(0) \\times t^2,\n",
    "  \\)\n",
    "  where \\(P'(0)\\) is the short‐run rate of price change, and \\(P''(0)\\) captures acceleration/deceleration.\n",
    "- **Target Price Range**: We used bounding assumptions to converge on \\$0.88–\\$0.90 as a near‐term local high that still has a strong probability of being reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Business Analytics Approach\n",
    "1. **Historic Patterns**: We look at prior short bounces in the same token (e.g., a 10–15% rebound after significant sell‐offs).\n",
    "2. **Market Liquidity**: Evaluate orderbook depth around \\$0.88–\\$0.90 to ensure there is sufficient buy interest to fill a 50% liquidation.\n",
    "3. **Risk Tolerance**: A balanced approach—selling only 50%—locks in partial gains while retaining upside if the token spikes beyond \\$0.90.\n"

    "## 5. Proposed Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
    "   - Automate retrieval of hourly OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data from the exchange’s API.\n",
    "   - Track real‐time orderbook depth, focusing on \\$0.88–\\$0.90 tiers.\n",
    "2. **Forecast/Scenario Updates**:\n",
    "   - Run a short‐term trend model (e.g., a simple ARIMA or Holt‐Winters approach) to confirm the plausibility of reaching the target price.\n",
    "   - If macro or crypto‐wide sentiments shift (e.g., sudden Bitcoin rallies), adjust the forecast accordingly.\n",
    "3. **Limit Order Placement**:\n",
    "   - Place a **limit sell** at \\$0.88–\\$0.90 for 50% of the token holdings.\n",
    "   - Optional: Scale out in small increments (e.g., some at \\$0.88, some at \\$0.90) to improve fill probability.\n",
    "4. **Monitoring & Alerts**:\n",
    "   - Set alerts for price crossing \\$0.85 downward or \\$0.90 upward.\n",
    "   - If price action diverges from expectations, reevaluate the position (e.g., if bullish news emerges, consider revising the ask price upward; if the market dumps, consider partial exit at market rates).\n"

    "## 6. KPIs & Criteria for Success\n",
    "1. **Order Execution Rate**: Did at least 80% of the intended sell order fill by 48 hours?\n",
    "2. **Average Sell Price**: Did the realized average sell price exceed \\$0.88, our lower bound of the target range?\n",
    "3. **ROI**: Compare realized partial liquidation proceeds (\\(0.5 \\times \\text{holdings} \\times \\text{sell price}\\)) to the proceeds if we had sold at the current price (\\$0.85).\n",
    "4. **Volatility Exposure**: Measure the maximum adverse price movement prior to sell execution (i.e., how low did it drop before rebounding?).\n"

    "## 7. Conclusion & Next Steps\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "- A limit‐sell target of **\\$0.88–\\$0.90** is a reasonable short‐term objective for 50% liquidation. This range:\n",
    "  1. Captures a moderate expected bounce (if realized),\n",
    "  2. Balances a high probability of order fill, and\n",
    "  3. Secures partial gains while leaving upside in place for the remaining 50% of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**\n",
    "- Implement the PoC with live orderbook monitoring and real‐time price alerts.\n",
    "- A/B test with slightly different limit‐sell levels (e.g., \\$0.88 vs. \\$0.90) to see which yields higher execution rates and better returns.\n",
    "- Evolve the short‐term forecasting model by incorporating more complex signals (e.g., social media sentiment, correlation with major cryptos, macroeconomic drivers).\n",
