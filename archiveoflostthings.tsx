      <h1>🌑 “THE ARCHIVE OF LOST THINGS” 🌑</h1>
      <p>
        A Mothman Tale of Truths, Tricksters, and the Weight of Forgotten Histories
      </p>

      <p>
        It started in the ruins of a library that never should have burned.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Pooka—Foxglove—hopped between the scorched shelves, whistling as
        though they hadn’t watched the flames eat through the stories of their
        own bloodline.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It wasn’t my library,” they said aloud, even though no one had asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        And from the shadows of the collapsed rafters, the Mothman blinked.
      </p>

      <p>
        His eyes—great and red as wounds left too long in the open air—flickered
        with recognition. He had seen Foxglove’s kind before.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ones who lied with every breath not out of malice, but because the
        truth had already been taken from them once before.
      </p>

      <p>
        He landed beside them in a flutter of dust and unsaid names.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re digging in the wrong ashes,” Mothman said, voice a dissonance of
        radio static and whispering wings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Foxglove turned, ears twitching, that Pooka grin flashing like a knife in
        candlelight. “Oh, this isn’t mine, darling. I was just curious, you know,
        in the way of all wandering spirits.”
      </p>

      <p>Mothman tilted his head. “A Pooka pretending not to grieve is still a Boggin by any other name.”</p>

      <p>Foxglove froze.</p>

      <p>
        Mothman sighed, settling into his haunches. His wings, too large for a
        creature that should not be, curled inward, closing off the outside
        world.
      </p>

      <p>
        He spoke as though he was opening a book bound in red string and
        teethmarks, something stolen but never forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Once, there was a family that carried their history like a heavy box
        strapped to their backs. Every generation added something to the
        weight—a secret, a betrayal, a wound that never quite healed. They
        never set the box down, never dared to open it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because inside, they knew they’d find a history that did not belong to
        them, but one they had been forced to inherit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Foxglove’s ears flicked back. “Sounds like a very tragic family. But
        not mine.”
      </p>

      <p>Mothman said nothing.</p>

      <p>
        He only reached into the ash and pulled free something small, scorched,
        but still whole.
      </p>

      <p>
        A wooden case, the kind carried by Boggins of old, the ones who knew
        that stories were meant to be archived, preserved, protected—even if
        the people who carried them could not be.
      </p>

      <p>Foxglove swallowed.</p>

      <p>
        Mothman turned the case in his clawed hands, considering the burn marks,
        the edges where Foxglove’s family name had once been inscribed but had
        been scratched away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can pretend you’re not carrying the box,” he murmured, “but your
        hands are still shaped by the weight of it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Foxglove’s grin twitched at the edges. They could lie—they could twist
        this, dance around the meaning, turn it into a joke, a trick, a passing
        fancy.
      </p>

      <p>Their hands itched to take the case.</p>
      <p>Their fingers twitched with recognition.</p>

      <p>
        And they knew, in that moment, that Mothman had already won.
      </p>

      <div className="moral">
        <p>
          The Moral of the Story?
        </p>
        <p>
          A Pooka may tell a thousand stories, but the truth they run from still
          waits between the lines.
        </p>
        <p>And Mothman always knows where to find them.</p>
