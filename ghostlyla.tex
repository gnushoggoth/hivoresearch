\section*{Summary}
The optimal price to sell 50\% of your holdings based on revenue maximization is approximately \$1.0008. This corresponds to the upper bound of the recovery projection.

\section*{Key Insights}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Revenue Optimization:} At this price, the combination of price and available liquidity ensures the highest possible revenue from the sale of your tokens.
    \item \textbf{Practical Considerations:} The market depth suggests that achieving this price may require waiting for sufficient demand, as it represents the peak expected price based on recovery projections.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Analysis Details}
The analysis combines the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Current market data, including price and order book depth.
    \item Predicted recovery to \$1.0008 within the next 48 hours.
    \item Differential calculus to optimize the selling price based on revenue maximization.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
To achieve the highest revenue, aim to sell 50\% of your holdings at \$1.0008, if market conditions allow. However, for faster execution, consider a slightly lower price range (e.g., \$0.95â€“\$0.98) depending on your liquidity needs.
