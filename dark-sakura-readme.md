## 🌙 Overview

Dark Sakura Dreams is a multi-paradigm art framework exploring the intersection of digital identity, consciousness, and traditional Japanese aesthetics. It exists simultaneously as:

- A functional programming meditation
- A UbiArt Framework extension
- A Changeling: The Dreaming digital grimoire
- A commentary on digital identity theft
- A love letter to ethereal animation

## 💫 Core Features

- Multi-paradigm implementation (Haskell/Clojure/Rust)
- Real-time particle system driven by dream logic
- Quantum-entangled animation states
- Digital identity protection through glamour
- Cold iron network protocols
- Reality anchoring systems

## 🌸 Installation

```bash
# Clone the dreaming
git clone https://github.com/digital-fae/dark-sakura-dreams

# Enter the digital garden
cd dark-sakura-dreams

# Install dependencies (and accept the risks)
cargo install --features "glamour identity-protection cold-iron"

# Invoke the dreams
cargo run --release --features "reality-anchoring"
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Installation may draw attention from the Nobility. Proper wards advised.

## 🎮 Usage

```rust
// Basic dream invocation
let mut dreams = DarkSakura::new()?;
dreams.begin_meditation()?;

// For advanced users
dreams.weave_reality()?
      .invoke_glamour()?
      .resist_banality()?;
```
