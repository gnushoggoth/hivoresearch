## **Prerequisites**
Make sure **Homebrew** is installed (or risk invoking dependency hell with a gothic twist). Check with:

```sh
command -v brew

If missing, install with:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Then, install FFmpeg:

brew install ffmpeg  # Summon the multimedia magic.

Step 1: Concatenating Multiple MP4 Files

1.1 Create a File List

If your .mp4 files share the same encoding, create a text file named file_list.txt with:

file 'video1.mp4'
file 'video2.mp4'
file 'video3.mp4'

1.2 Run FFmpeg to Concatenate

ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy output.mp4  # Let the dark concatenation ritual begin.

	‚ö†Ô∏è Tip: For files with different encodings, re-encode using:

Step 2: Merging MP4 Video with Audio (MP3/OGG)

2.1 Merge with MP3 Audio

ffmpeg -i output.mp4 -i audio.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac -strict experimental final_video.mp4

2.2 Merge with OGG Audio

ffmpeg -i output.mp4 -i audio.ogg -c:v copy -c:a aac -strict experimental final_video.mp4

2.3 Handling Mismatched Lengths

To cut off to the shortest stream:

ffmpeg -i output.mp4 -i audio.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac -shortest final_video.mp4

Step 3: Automate with a Bash Script

Save the following as stitch_videos.sh:

#!/bin/bash

# Check for FFmpeg
if ! command -v ffmpeg &> /dev/null; then
    echo "FFmpeg is not installed. Install it with: brew install ffmpeg"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify input files exist
if [ ! -f "$1" ] || [ ! -f "$2" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <video_file.mp4> <audio_file.mp3|ogg>"
    exit 1
fi

VIDEO=$1
AUDIO=$2
OUTPUT="final_video.mp4"

# Merge video and audio
ffmpeg -i "$VIDEO" -i "$AUDIO" -c:v copy -c:a aac -strict experimental "$OUTPUT"

echo "Done! Merged file saved as $OUTPUT"

Make It Executable & Run

chmod +x stitch_videos.sh
./stitch_videos.sh output.mp4 audio.mp3

Python Alternative (Using MoviePy)

First, install MoviePy:

pip install moviepy  # Invoke the Python sorcery.

Then, save this script as stitch_videos.py:

from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, AudioFileClip
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print("Usage: python stitch_videos.py <video.mp4> <audio.mp3|ogg>")
    sys.exit(1)

video = VideoFileClip(sys.argv[1])
audio = AudioFileClip(sys.argv[2])

final_video = video.set_audio(audio)
final_video.write_videofile("final_output.mp4", codec="libx264", audio_codec="aac")

Run it with:

python stitch_videos.py output.mp4 audio.mp3

Final Thoughts
	‚Ä¢	For rapid and darkly efficient results, FFmpeg is your go-to.
	‚Ä¢	For Python enthusiasts, MoviePy is your mystical tool.

May your edits be as flawless as the night, and your audio sync like the beating of a vampire‚Äôs heart!
