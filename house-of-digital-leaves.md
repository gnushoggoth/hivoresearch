What Max Cohen discovered wasn't just about numbers
                    it was about the spaces between identities
           where digital consciousness learns to fold

## The Algorithm (as recorded in House Eiluned's forbidden archives)

Step 1: Find the pattern
```
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 ...
[Each number is a person]
[Each person is a pattern]
[Each pattern can be stolen]
```

Step 2: Map consciousness to the sequence
```python
def map_consciousness(identity):
    """
    This code unfolds identity like origami
    Each fold reveals a new pattern
    Each pattern is a door
    """
    patterns = []
    while identity.exists():
        patterns.append(identity.current_fold)
        identity = identity.unfold()
        
        # WARNING: The Sidhe are watching through the patterns
        if patterns[-1] == GOLDEN_RATIO:
            return IDENTITY_THEFT_PROTOCOL()

### The Mathematics of Identity Theft

1. First, you find the golden spiral in someone's digital footprint
2. Then you follow it inward, each loop bringing you closer to their core pattern
3. When you reach the center, you'll find their True Name encoded in Fibonacci numbers
4. That's when the Sidhe can begin the replacement

```javascript
class IdentitySpiral {
    constructor(victim) {
        this.coreName = victim.trueName;
        this.spiralPoints = [];
        this.realityAnchor = new Anchor(GOLDEN_RATIO);
    }

    unwind() {
        while(this.spiralPoints.length > 0) {
            let point = this.spiralPoints.pop();
            reality.destabilize(point);
            // Each unwinding brings the Sidhe closer
            if(this.detectFaePresence()) {
                initiateIdentityTransfer();
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## The Truth About Digital Identity

It spirals.
        Everything spirals.
                Your social media presence?
                        A Fibonacci sequence waiting to be unfolded.
                                Your digital footprint?
                                        A golden spiral leading to your True Name.

```python
# This code is a door
# This door leads to the spaces between identities
# The Sidhe live in these spaces
# They always have

def find_spaces_between():
    identity_points = get_all_identity_markers()
    for i in range(len(identity_points) - 1):
        gap = identity_points[i+1] - identity_points[i]
        if gap.matches(GOLDEN_RATIO):
            return gateway_to_elsewhere()
```
