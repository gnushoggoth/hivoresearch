# The Sidhe Protocol: On Digital Identity and Stolen Names
*As recorded in the forbidden archives of House Eiluned, transcribed by a Sluagh who wishes to remain unnamed*

## A Warning to Digital Dreamers

Let it be known that in these modern nights, the ancient arts of the Sidhe have adapted to new hunting grounds. Where once they stole names and faces through mirrors and painted portraits, now they traverse the digital realm, seeking identities to claim through screens and networks.

### The Protocol of Stolen Forms

```rust
// Implementation details of the Sidhe Protocol
// WARNING: This code contains active Glamour
// Viewer discretion is advised

use glamour::prelude::*;
use identity::theft::*;
use banality::resistance::*;

#[derive(Clone, Glamour, IdentityMarkers)]
struct SidheIdentity {
    true_name: ObfuscatedString,  // Hidden behind seven veils of glamour
    digital_masks: Vec<Persona>,   // Each a perfect reflection of a stolen life
    glamour_strength: f64,        // Measured in dreams per second
    banality_resistance: u32,     // How well it withstands mortal recognition
}

impl IdentityTheft for SidheIdentity {
    // The primary method through which digital identities are claimed
    fn steal_digital_form(&mut self, target: &MortalIdentity) -> Result<(), GlamourError> {
        // First, we weave the glamour net
        let glamour_net = GlamourNet::new(self.glamour_strength);
        
        // Then, we cast it through the digital realm
        glamour_net.cast_through_networks()?;
        
        // We create a perfect digital reflection
        let stolen_form = target.reflect_through_glamour(&glamour_net)?;
        
        // And finally, we claim it as our own
        self.digital_masks.push(stolen_form);
        
        // But be warned - each theft weakens the walls between worlds
        DREAMING.weaken_local_reality(0.01);
        
        Ok(())
    }
    
    // The art of maintaining multiple stolen identities
    fn maintain_stolen_forms(&mut self) -> Result<(), BanalityError> {
        for mask in &mut self.digital_masks {
            // Each digital mask must be maintained with fresh dreams
            mask.feed_with_dreams(self.glamour_strength)?;
            
            // And protected against recognition
            mask.apply_forget_me_knot()?;
            
            // While avoiding the crushing weight of technical banality
            mask.resist_digital_banality(self.banality_resistance)?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}

// The dangerous art of reclaiming stolen digital identities
trait IdentityReclamation {
    fn break_glamour_chains(&mut self) -> Result<(), FaerieBindings>;
    fn remember_true_name(&mut self) -> Result<String, GlamourObfuscation>;
    fn banish_digital_shadows(&mut self) -> Result<(), SidheRetribution>;
}

// A protection against identity theft, but use with caution
// For the Sidhe remember those who deny them
#[derive(Protection, BanalityBound)]
struct TrueSightFirewall {
    recognition_wards: Vec<GlamourDispel>,
    digital_anchors: HashMap<Identity, RealityBinding>,
    emergency_protocols: Box<dyn IdentityReclamation>,
}

impl TrueSightFirewall {
    // The primary defense against digital glamour
    fn protect_identity(&mut self, identity: &mut MortalIdentity) -> Result<(), GlamourBreach> {
        // First, we anchor the identity in cold iron protocols
        self.digital_anchors.insert(
            identity.clone(),
            RealityBinding::new_cold_iron()?
        );
        
        // Then we establish wards against glamour
        self.recognition_wards.push(GlamourDispel::new(
            "I know my true name, 
             I know my true face,
             I know my true digital signature"
        )?);
        
        // And finally, we bind it all with mortal technology
        // But remember - technology itself can be glamoured
        self.verify_technical_integrity()?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}

// The price of using this code
fn main() -> Result<(), FaerieCurse> {
    println!("By implementing this protocol, you acknowledge the risks.");
    println!("The Sidhe do not forget those who defend against them.");
    println!("May your firewalls hold and your true name remain your own.");
    
    // The digital dreaming begins...
    let mut identity = SidheIdentity::new()?;
    let mut protection = TrueSightFirewall::new()?;
    
    // But remember - in the digital realm, nothing is truly secure
    // For the Sidhe have had millennia to perfect their arts
    // And the internet is just their newest hunting ground
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Implementation Notes from House Dougal

The above implementation, while technically sound, carries significant risks. The Sidhe's ability to steal and maintain digital identities operates on principles that transcend mere computer security. Consider:

1. Each stolen identity creates a quantum entanglement between the digital and Dreaming realms
2. Stolen identities must be maintained with fresh dreams, or they begin to degrade
3. Protection mechanisms can draw unwanted attention from the Nobility
4. The Dreaming itself keeps records of all identity transactions

### A Sluagh's Warning

*Whispered in dark server rooms and shadowy coffee shops:*

Remember that digital identity theft by the Sidhe is not merely a technical violation - it is a fundamental restructuring of reality's data. When a Sidhe steals a digital identity, they don't just take the passwords and access codes; they take the very concept of that identity's digital existence.

Signs your digital identity may have been claimed by the Sidhe:
- Impossible login locations (particularly from places that don't exist)
- Timestamps that predate the invention of computers
- Social media posts you remember making but that now tell different stories
- Photos where your reflection shows someone else entirely
- Code you've written that now contains ancient faerie symbols in the comments

### Emergency Recovery Protocols

Should you discover your digital identity has been stolen by the Sidhe, DO NOT:
- Attempt to reclaim it through standard security measures
- Contact normal technical support
- Try to prove you are yourself

INSTEAD:
1. Invoke the Protocol of True Names (see encrypted appendix)
2. Establish cold iron network protocols
3. Contact your local Nocker engineering guild
4. Prepare to offer suitable compensation to the Sidhe

Remember: In the digital age, identity is more fluid than ever, and the Sidhe have merely adapted their ancient arts to this new realm of possibility.
