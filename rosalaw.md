## Evolution of the Term "Mental Retardation" and Rosa's Law in Texas Educational Context

### Early Usage and Clinical Context

**Initial Clinical Application:**
- "Mental retardation" initially emerged as a clinical term in the early 20th century to describe individuals with intellectual impairments. This terminology was broadly accepted in both clinical and educational environments to categorize cognitive delays.
- Texas reflected national practices; the state's first institution for individuals with intellectual disabilities, established in 1917, was originally named the "State Colony for Feebleminded" and later renamed the Austin State School in 1925 ([Texas State Historical Association, 2024](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/texas-department-of-mental-health-and-mental-retardation)).

**Educational Practices:**
- Educational systems, including Texas, frequently segregated students with intellectual disabilities. Terms such as "mental retardation" reflected contemporary clinical perspectives, influencing educational materials and approaches.

### Shift in Social Perception and Educational Changes

**Increased Awareness and Advocacy:**
- Growing societal awareness regarding disability rights spotlighted the negative impacts associated with terms like "mental retardation." Advocacy groups, families, and individuals with disabilities pushed for respectful language and inclusive educational practices.

**Changes in Texas Education:**
- Texas revised educational policies significantly due to increased awareness and advocacy:
  - The Texas Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1965 led to the establishment of the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, centralizing services ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Mental_Health_and_Mental_Retardation_Act_of_1965)).
  - In the 1980s, Texas emphasized community-based care over institutionalization, leading to further policy and terminology revisions ([Texas State Historical Association, 2024](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/texas-department-of-mental-health-and-mental-retardation)).
  - Educational materials were updated, adopting the term "intellectual disability" and person-first language.

### Rosa's Law and Federal Influence

**Overview of Rosa's Law:**
- Signed into law by President Barack Obama on October 5, 2010, Rosa's Law replaced the term "mental retardation" with "intellectual disability" in federal statutes relating to health, education, and labor. Rosa's Law was inspired by Rosa Marcellino, a young girl with Down syndrome, whose family advocated strongly for person-first language ([Special Olympics, 2024](https://www.specialolympics.org/stories/news/rosas-law-signed-into-law-by-president-obama)).

**Impact on Federal Legislation:**
- Rosa's Law directly amended several federal statutes:
  - **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA):** The term "mental retardation" was officially replaced with "intellectual disability," redefining the classification used in special education programs ([Berchem Moses, 2024](https://www.berchemmoses.com/updated-federal-regulations-rosas-law-changes-section-504-and-idea-references-from-mental-retardation-to-intellectual-disability/)).
  - **Rehabilitation Act of 1973:** Federal statutes were uniformly updated to reflect the language changes mandated by Rosa's Law ([Federal Register, 2024](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/07/11/2017-14343/rosas-law)).

### Implementation in Texas Educational Systems

- Following federal changes, Texas actively aligned state educational policies:
  - **Policy Revisions:** Texas Education Agency (TEA) revised official guidelines, policies, and educational materials to ensure compliance with federal standards.
  - **Professional Development:** Training for educators and administrators emphasized respectful, inclusive language and practices.
  - **Individualized Education Programs (IEPs):** Terminology in IEP documentation was updated consistently to reflect the federal mandate.

### Current Acceptability and Ongoing Efforts

- Currently, terms like "mental retardation" are deemed outdated and offensive within Texas educational settings. The preferred terminology emphasizes "intellectual disability," placing importance on respect and inclusion.
- Continued advocacy and educational efforts ensure:
  - Public and professional awareness about respectful language.
  - Ongoing policy reviews and updates reflecting societal attitudes toward disability rights.

### Key Considerations

- Historical documents may contain outdated language, illustrating the terminological evolution.
- Language changes mirror broader societal shifts toward inclusion and disability awareness.
- Education practices continuously adapt, promoting respect and inclusivity for all students.

The historical progression marked by Rosa's Law signifies a broader movement toward dignity, respect, and inclusion within educational and societal frameworks.
