Hereâ€™s a simpler version of the fix for your Steam Deck stuck on verifying installation issue. Also, yes, this works from macOS if youâ€™re just following basic steps, but youâ€™ll need a USB drive if you have to do a recovery.

Step 1: Restart the Steam Deck

Try first:
	â€¢	Hold the power button for 10 seconds to force a shutdown.
	â€¢	Turn it back on and see if it gets past the verifying screen.

Step 2: Check Internet Connection
	â€¢	If possible, use Ethernet (dock required) or a stronger Wi-Fi connection.
	â€¢	If Steam canâ€™t verify files due to network issues, it might be stuck.

Step 3: Boot into Desktop Mode
	â€¢	Hold the power button â†’ Select Switch to Desktop Mode.
	â€¢	Open Steam (desktop version) and check if the update is stuck.
	â€¢	Try launching the game from Desktop Mode instead of Gaming Mode.

Step 4: Clear Steam Download Cache
	â€¢	Go to Settings â†’ Storage â†’ Manage Storage
	â€¢	Locate your game and force revalidate or uninstall/reinstall it.
	â€¢	OR from Desktop Mode:
	1.	Open Steam
	2.	Click Steam (top-left) â†’ Settings
	3.	Go to Downloads â†’ Clear Download Cache

Step 5: Check for Corrupt SD Card
	â€¢	If your game is on an SD card, try running it from internal storage instead.
	â€¢	Reformat the SD card from Steam Deck Settings â†’ System â†’ Format SD Card (this will erase everything on it).

Step 6: Reinstall SteamOS (Only If Nothing Else Works)

If everything fails, you might need to reinstall SteamOS:
	1.	Download the Steam Deck Recovery Image (from Valveâ€™s site).
	2.	Flash it to a USB drive using Balena Etcher (works on macOS).
	3.	Boot the Steam Deck from USB (hold Volume Down + Power).
	4.	Choose Reinstall SteamOS (this keeps your games & settings).

TL;DR: Try This First
	1.	Force restart (hold power 10 sec).
	2.	Check internet & restart Steam.
	3.	Try Desktop Mode & launch the game.
	4.	Clear download cache.
	5.	If game is on SD card, move it to internal storage.
	6.	LAST RESORT: Reinstall SteamOS via USB.

Hope this helps! If youâ€™re still stuck, lmk what happens after Step 3. ðŸš€
