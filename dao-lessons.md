# So You've Inherited a DAO: A Cautionary Tale

## Congratulations on Your New Responsibility!

First of all, dear reader, let me extend my heartfelt congratulations on your recent acquisition of organizational responsibility! How exciting it must be to suddenly find yourself at the helm of a technical organization, especially one that you haven't built, maintained, or really contributed to in any meaningful engineering capacity. What an opportunity for growth!

## Understanding What You Actually Have

Now, you might be wondering why things seem a bit... different since you took over. Why tasks that used to "just happen" are suddenly becoming complicated multi-week ordeals. Why that engineering backlog keeps growing instead of shrinking. Why those Discord channels seem quieter than before.

Let me explain something that might have escaped your notice: You haven't inherited a kingdom â€“ you've inherited a responsibility. And darling, those are very different things.

## The Invisible Architecture of Success

You see, before your glorious ascension, there was this fascinating phenomenon occurring: actual engineers were doing actual work. I know, I know â€“ it's shocking to consider that all those systems weren't just running themselves through the power of positive thinking and good vibes.

Remember that person you kept arguing with about technical decisions? The one who somehow always managed to keep things running despite your helpful suggestions about how they should do their job? They weren't just being difficult â€“ they were being an engineer. And now that they're gone, you might start to notice some interesting developments.

## Signs You Might Be In Trouble

Here are some early warning signs that your inheritance might not be the crown jewel you imagined:

1. Production systems are starting to have "personality quirks" that no one knows how to fix
2. Documentation links lead to pages that no longer exist
3. Your attempts to rally the community are met with increasingly lengthy silences
4. The phrase "but it used to work" is becoming a regular part of your vocabulary

## The Economics of Free Labor

Here's a delightful little secret about technical talent: they usually have options. Lots of them. When you inherited this DAO, you might have thought you were getting free access to all that expertise that made things run smoothly. Unfortunately, expertise tends to walk out the door when it realizes its value isn't being recognized.

Pro tip: Engineers who work for free do so because they believe in something. Once that belief evaporates, they tend to remember that their skills are worth actual money elsewhere.

## The True Cost of "Taking Charge"

Remember all those times you asserted your authority over technical decisions you didn't quite understand? Those moments when you were sure you knew better than the people actually building the systems? Well, congratulations â€“ you've won! You now have complete authority over everything. Absolutely everything. Every single technical decision, infrastructure problem, and system failure is now yours to handle.

Isn't it funny how victory sometimes feels suspiciously like being alone in a room full of broken things?

## Looking Forward: A Preview of Coming Attractions

In the weeks and months ahead, you might notice some interesting patterns emerging:

- Systems that used to "just work" will develop mysterious ailments
- Simple tasks will become surprisingly complex
- Technical documentation will feel increasingly like ancient hieroglyphics
- That engineering talent you were sure you could easily replace will somehow remain frustratingly unreplaced

## A Note on Value Recognition

Here's a fun fact about technical infrastructure: Like good health, you tend to notice it most when it's gone. Those engineers who "weren't doing much" were actually performing the organizational equivalent of keeping your blood circulating and your neurons firing. But hey â€“ how hard could that be to replace?

## In Conclusion: A Learning Opportunity

Consider this moment a beautiful opportunity for personal growth. You've been handed exactly what you asked for â€“ complete control over a technical organization. The fact that it might not work quite the same way without all those pesky engineers who used to maintain it... well, that's just part of the learning experience, isn't it?

Remember: A DAO without engineers is like a Ferrari without an engine â€“ impressive to look at, but not going anywhere particularly interesting.

Best of luck with your inheritance! I'm sure you'll do just fine. After all, how hard could it be to replace someone who was "just writing code" and "managing infrastructure" and "keeping everything from exploding"?

## Bonus Section: Managing Your Cognitive Load

Dear newly-minted leader, I couldn't help but notice you're trying to personally manage every single relationship in your inherited organization! How ambitious of you. Since you're so interested in getting to know everyone personally (including what they look like, their pets' names, and their entire life story), let me offer some helpful suggestions for managing your rapidly approaching cognitive limits:

1. Consider starting a spreadsheet to track all the people you've alienated. Color-coding is helpful! Red for "stormed out dramatically," yellow for "quietly stopped contributing," and green for "hasn't realized what's happening yet."

2. When you feel that telling twinge of your brain reaching Dunbar's number, try this mindfulness exercise: Take a deep breath and repeat "I am not actually required to know what everyone looks like on this blockchain."

3. If you find yourself struggling to remember which person you're supposed to be in conflict with this week, don't worry! Just rotate through them alphabetically. Efficiency is key.

4. When your brain starts feeling like a RAM stick that's about to catch fire from trying to micromanage 150+ relationships simultaneously, remember: This is what organizational structures were invented for! But you knew that already, right?

5. Pro tip: If you find yourself saying "Why can't everyone just get along?" more than three times per day, consider that the common denominator in all these conflicts might not be everyone else.

P.S. When things start breaking, try using more emoji in your announcements. I hear that helps with technical problems.

P.P.S. Remember: Just because you can see everyone's profile picture doesn't mean you need to form a personal opinion about each one. Sometimes the healthiest relationship with a community member is no relationship at all. ðŸ’•
